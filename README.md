Biologist specialized in immunology and biologics, with hands-on experience across experimental design, data interpretation, and translational thinking from mechanism to preclinical relevance at Sanofi and Lonza.

I build projects that bridge experimental immunology with computational modeling—turning complex biological data (e.g., single-cell and spatial) into predictive systems that can guide hypotheses, experiments, and preclinical strategy. I’m also working on Holocyte, a platform aiming to simulate and ultimately replace key parts of in vitro and in vivo testing.

## Research interests
- ML for biology (graph models, representation learning, multimodal data).
- Virtual cell + data-driven modeling of cell states and cell–cell interactions.
- ML-enabled drug discovery & biologics engineering (design, optimization, and developability).
- Preclinical translation with ML (biomarkers, stratification, response prediction, decision support).

## Looking For

I’m looking to pursue a PhD at the intersection of immunology and machine learning, driven by a strong belief that the next era of biomedical progress will come from building real bridges between biology and computation.

Coming from a biology-first background, there is still a lot to learn on the technical side, and I’m actively working to deepen my skills in modeling and quantitative thinking. 
My goal is to combine my background in biology and immunology with my expertise in wet lab work and apply it to computer science. My ultimate goal is to start a company combining ML and biology to accelerate discovery, development, and processes related to biologics.
